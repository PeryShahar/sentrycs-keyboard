# ‚ö° Sentrycs Keyboard

This React application allows users to input words letter by letter and validates them against a real English dictionary. Once all letters are entered, the word is checked: valid words highlight the squares in green, while invalid entries trigger a red highlight. The interface provides immediate visual feedback, enhancing user interaction and clarity.
The system uses an event bus to keep components in sync and handle updates efficiently, making the app more responsive and easy to manage.
